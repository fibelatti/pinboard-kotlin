<b>PROJECT STATUS</b>

As of October of 2019 Pinkt can offer everything that the Pinboard API officially supports. It will continue to be maintained and updated to support the latest Android technologies since this is a personal sandbox, but it is limited in regards to what it can offer without official support from the Pinboard API, which hasn't been actively maintained from what it seems.

Some examples of what I'm currently unable to offer are Bulk Edit and better pagination support for people with a massive amount of bookmarks saved without compromising the filtering capabilities that Pinkt currently offers.

Even though updates will be less frequent, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have an idea or a feature request as I'm always keen to improve the experience for my users.
