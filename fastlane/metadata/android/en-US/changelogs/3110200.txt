This version brings the following updates:

* Fixes the cursor behavior when editing the bookmark title
* Fixes the follow redirect behavior for Google URLs
* Removes preferred sorting setting. The applied sorting is always saved now
* Pinboard: Disables the URL input when editing an existing bookmark

Given how the Pinboard API works, editing the URL would always result in a new
bookmark. This change aims to prevents this type of accidental duplication.

Thank you for using the app!
