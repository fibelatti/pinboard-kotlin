About the project
--------

Pinkt is a playground to study modern Android development.

Here you will find a codebase that encourages the usage of state using Kotlin Coroutines + Kotlin Flows as foundation for a pragmatic unidirectional dataflow implementation. These are some of the topics you can expect to see:
- Material Design, including Material 3
- Android Jetpack, including WorkManager and Room (with FTS)
- Kotlin, Coroutines and Flows
- DI using Hilt
- Detekt
- CI with GitHub Actions
